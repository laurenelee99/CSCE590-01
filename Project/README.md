# Comparing Standardized Test Scores

The goal of this model is to predict how eaech student group will perform on a specific standardized test per district/school. 

## Description

The motivation for this project was to determine whether states with different percentages of poverty have major deviations within their standardized test scores. Each state has the liberty to declare their own standardized tests. This research focused on states who required ELA and Math tests. This research can help school leaders and state officials discover disadvantages between school groups. This discovery will help pinpoint the source of any disadvantages and aid in eliminating any prejudices. Research like this is crucial to promoting equal learning for all student groups to create a more diverse future within schools and professions. There is a stark disparity between household incomes and the top one percentâ€™s earnings. In my opinion, this can correlate with schooling and opportunities student groups are given. There is very little to no representation of African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, Asians, and Multiracial groups in the top one percent [1].  It is time to diversify the United States wealth. To start, we need to look at success in school.
